# mashiko_2022_Sci_Rep
Image analysis code used in Mashiko et al. 2022 Sci. Rep. 

This repository include
+ readme: this file
+ sample_code.nb: Mathematica code to run the image processing algorithm used in the paper.
+ TIFF: TIFF version of the image used in the sample.
+ Dump: Dammy folder in which Mathematica Dump file of the images used in the sample code should be stored

The content of a dump file, W1F002TallC2E03, is identical to that of TIFF file.
Othe damp files are the results of image processing and mannually 


## Installation: 
copy this following files in the repository by keeping the subfolder structure:
+ sample_code.nb
+ TIFF/
+ Dump/

Mathematica Dump file is beyond the size capacity of github repository.
Download it from here and store it in the dammy Dump folder.

## Execution:
Sample_code.nb was implemented on Mathematica ver11 and tested by Mathematica ver10, ver 11 on Mac Book Pro with Intel processor.
The latest version of Mathematica, especially that for Mac M1 processor, contains bugs around 3D visualization functions.
If the code crushes in your environment, please try Mathematica of older version on an Intel Mac computer.
